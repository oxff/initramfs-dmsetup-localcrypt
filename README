initramfs hook for dmcrypt "localcrypt"


For expert users only!


This repository contains an initramfs-tools hook that dumps keys for all
active dm_crypt targets at initramfs creation into the initramfs file. An
additional script will then re-create all these dm_crypt targets during the next
boot. Additionally, mkinitramfs will be patched to ensure that create initramfs
images are only owner-readable.

Since this approach makes use of raw `dmsetup table`, it implicitly relies on
source device major and minor numbers to stay fixed between initramfs creation
and the reboot. This is typically the case for /dev/sd* devices but you may
encounter problems with mdraid or lvm based source devices.

As a beauitful side-effect, you will not need the cryptsetup binary, let alone
dropbear in your initramfs anymore.

If (and only if) /boot itself resides on an encrypted dm_crypt target, this is
reasonably secure for a kexec based setup, where no unencrypted data resides on
the hard-disk at all, yet allowing for seamless unattended reboots (e.g. for
applying kernel upgrades).

It is left as an exercise to the reader how to boot the system after full power
off.


Trivially arm your /etc/initramfs-tools and /etc/default/kexec.d using the
following commands:

# make && make install
